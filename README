This is a collection of pcb plugins collected from the 
geda mailing lists.

WARNING: before using one of these plugins make sure you 
         backup your previous work ! and make sure that 
         you apply these in a safe sandbox (not having 
         an influence on other work).

There happens to be some documentation included in both the
source (files) and in the doc directory, the latter if this
was available at the time of the publication.
